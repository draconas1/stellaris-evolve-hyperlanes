[h1]Evolving Hyperlanes Redux (3.7)[/h1]
An update and refresh of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1733757326]Arkys Evolving Hyperlanes[/url].  With permission from Arky

This mod helps grow out the exploration phase by making some stars inaccessible at game start, and by having the hyperlane network shift and evolve over time.

[list]
[*] HyperLanes grow and change over time, creating a more dynamic galaxy.
[*] At game start many stars will be isolated and inaccessible.
[*] Connections between pulsars will fluctuate often. They will lose and create new HyperLanes to their neighbours
[*] Technology that grants starbase buildings to stabilise or grow the hyperlane network, and eventually, to remove hyperlanes
[*] Hyperlanes with hyper-relays between them are stabilised and will not drop
[*] AI will grow hyperlanes to expand their empire and grow connections to empires they are attacking
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility & Disclaimer[/h1]
[list]
[*] May cause a lag when generating new HyperLanes depending on your PC and Galaxy size! 
[*] Play tested but certain events, special projects/anomalies could be effected.  Feedback on where you faced an issue can help smooth out bugs!
[*] Overrides message_types.txt, so will clash with any other mod that adds custom alert messages.
